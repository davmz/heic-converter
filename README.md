# 🖼️ HEIC Converter (Terminal Edition)

A simple Python-based CLI tool that converts `.heic` image files into `.jpg` format. Will push out to other formats but jpg for now.

## 📦 Features

- Converts single `.heic` files to `.jpg`
- Auto-saves to a `converted_images/` folder
- Automatically appends a suffix (e.g., `_1`, `_2`, etc.) if a file with the same name already exists
- Runs directly in terminal with simple prompts
- Displays total time taken for each conversion

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/davmz/heic-converter.git
